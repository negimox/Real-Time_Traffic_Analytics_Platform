# Real-Time Traffic Analytics

Made for "Innovate or Evaporate" 24 hour hackathon.

Our proposed system addresses the challenge of real-time traffic density calculation by leveraging image processing and object detection. It utilizes images captured from CCTV cameras at traffic junctions as input data. The system comprises three core modules:

### 1. Vehicle Detection Module:

This module is responsible for accurately identifying and counting vehicles within the camera footage.

### 2. Signal Switching Algorithm:

Based on the real-time traffic density data provided by the Vehicle Detection Module, this module dynamically optimizes traffic light timing to improve traffic flow.

### 3. Simulation Module (Optional):

This optional module can be used to simulate traffic scenarios based on historical data and the real-time vehicle detection results. This allows for testing and refining the Signal Switching Algorithm before real-world deployment.
